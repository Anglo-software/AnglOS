# Angl-OS Documentation

This OS is very much **IN PROGRESS**

It is by no means functional for actual use, yet (but I'm getting there slowly but surely)

Currently it can boot, load custom GDT, IDT, and TSS, process keyboard input and display it, and allocate physical, virtual, and heap memory.

Current task: User space

What's next: Proper VGA driver, basic scheduling, shell, expanded libc
