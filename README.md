# Angl-OS Documentation

This OS is very much **IN PROGRESS**

It is by no means functional for actual use, yet (but I'm getting there slowly but surely)

Currently it can boot, load custom GDT, IDT, and TSS, process keyboard input and display it, and allocate physical memory.

Current task: Allocating virtual memory and dynamic heap allocation

What's next: Proper VGA driver, APIC support, timer support, basic scheduling, user space, shell, expanded libc
